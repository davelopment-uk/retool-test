<p>We’ve been working this way for 12 years and so far it’s worked well. We’ve grown from a fledgling operation of just Myles and Ed (our two founders, who still lead the business today) to a global team of 190 with offices in Brighton (UK), Kyiv (Ukraine) and Valencia (Philippines).</p>
<p>Today we serve over 15,000 customers and have consistently grown by 20% each year. You’ll get to work with businesses of all sizes from small marketing agencies, right up to big brands such as Co-op, Krispy Kreme, Halfords and IKEA.</p>
<p>‘Enjoying work’ is a core company belief. You’ll experience this through our flexible working options (e.g. remote, core hours), our vibrant, energising and comfortable offices and regular team events. We believe that we’re nothing without strong, personal relationships and we carefully nurture these through a range of activities that cater to the interests of our diverse team - e.g. team lunches, social nights, escape rooms, cocktail making, learning to sail, scavenger hunts, paddle boarding etc…</p>
