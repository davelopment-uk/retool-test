  <h2 id="about-zava">About ZAVA</h2>
<p>We're on a mission to provide our patients with healthcare that is accessible and dependable at a fraction of today's cost. </p>
<p>Our team of Doctors, Engineers, Customer Support Advisors, Marketers, Product Managers, UX Designers, Pharmacists, and Commercial &amp; Operations Specialists work collaboratively, to develop and maintain a digital healthcare platform that provides our patients with healthcare that suits their needs &amp; schedules.</p>
<p>The pandemic changed our lives, requiring us to find flexible, remote and innovative healthcare solutions to meet our needs during challenging and changeable periods. Many of our patients turned to telemedicine as a convenient solution to getting their healthcare online from the comfort of their homes. And through delivering a safe and efficient digital healthcare service, we've provided over 7.8 million consultations across the UK, Germany, France, and Ireland, enabling millions of people with essential access to healthcare when they needed it most. </p>
<p>We're a scale-up company with ambitious growth plans, and our patients drive us. It's our motivation to continue fulfilling their needs and to expand further to meet the needs of others, ensuring we're always there with the latest tech, treatments and advice. Because we're doing more than providing healthcare, we're enabling &amp; empowering people by making healthcare work for them. </p>
<p>We’re here because we care about healthcare and we plan to be the largest digital primary healthcare platform for people across Europe.</p>
